#Feature: Validate API invocation with allowed scopes
#
#  Background:
##    Given I have initialized test instance
#    Given I have initialized the NodeApp server container
##    And I have initialized the Default API Manager container
#    And I have initialized the Custom API Manager container with label "allowedScope" and deployment toml file path at "/src/test/resources/features/allowedScopes/deployment.toml"
#    And I initialize the Publisher REST API client with username "admin", password "admin" and tenant "carbon.super"
#    And I initialize the Store REST API client with username "admin", password "admin" and tenant "carbon.super"
#
#  Scenario: Create an API with allowed scopes and invoke it based on scopes
##    When I create an API with name "allowedScopesAPI", context "allowedScopesAPI" and version "1.0.0"
#    And I create an API with the following details
#      | name         | allowedScopesAPI    |
#      | context      | allowedScopesAPI    |
#      | version      | 1.0.0               |
#    And I create scope "some_random_scope" with roles "admin"
#    And I create scope "scope2" with roles "admin"
#    And I add scopes "some_random_scope, scope2" to the created API with id "<createdApiId>"
#    Then the response status code should be 200
#
#      # Invoke API with scopes
##    And I add "/customers/{id}" operation with scopes "some_random_scope,scope2" to the created API with id "<createdApiId>"
##    And I deploy a revision of the API with id "<createdApiId>"
#    And I update API of id "<createdApiId>" with the following details
#      | operations          | [{"target":"/customers/{id}","verb":"GET","authType":"Application & Application User","throttlingPolicy":"Unlimited"}] |
#    And I deploy a revision of the API with id "<createdApiId>"
#    And I publish the API with id "<createdApiId>"
#    And I create an application with the following details
#      | name             | TestAppScope            |
#      | throttlingPolicy | Unlimited              |
#    Then I should be able to retrieve the application with id "<createdAppId>"
#    And I subscribe to API "<createdApiId>" using application "<createdAppId>" with throttling policy "Gold"
#    And I generate client credentials for application id "<createdAppId>" with key type "PRODUCTION"
#
#    # Access Token with Scope 1
#    And I request an access token using grant type "client_credentials" with scope "some_random_scope"
#    And I invoke API of ID "<createdApiId>" with path "/customers/123" and method GET using access token "<generatedAccessToken>"
#    Then the API response status should be 200
#
#    # Access Token with Scope 2
#    And I request an access token using grant type "client_credentials" with scope "scope2"
#    And I invoke API of ID "<createdApiId>" with path "/customers/123" and method GET using access token "<generatedAccessToken>"
#    Then the API response status should be 200
#
#    # Access Token with Scope 3 (not allowed)
#   # todo: check why this is not working ( we get 200 instead of 403)
#    And I request an access token using grant type "client_credentials" with scope "scope3"
#    And I invoke API of ID "<createdApiId>" with path "/customers/123" and method GET using access token "<generatedAccessToken>"
#    Then the API response status should be 403
#
#    # Access Token without scope
#    And I request an access token using grant type "client_credentials" without any scope
#    And I invoke API of ID "<createdApiId>" with path "/customers/123" and method GET using access token "<generatedAccessToken>"
#    Then the API response status should be 403
